# Wind-prediction-using-NN-Sklearn

The task at hand was:

Using machine learning try achieve the following:

i. A prediction algorithm for Wind Power with input variables being Temperature, Pressure, Wind speed and Wind Direction.
ii. Try improve the forecast in i. above by having a feedback loop where the error in the previous forecast (say at time T0) is used as an extra input in the next iteration (at time T1) with the aim of reducing errors in subsequent iterations. For this case we shall now have 5 inputs to our algorithm.
iii. Plot graphs of forecast wind power vs actual wind power for cases i. and ii.
